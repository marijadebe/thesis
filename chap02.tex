\chapter{Pointed acts}
\section{Basic notions}
    In this section we state and prove some basic facts about pointed acts, following \cite{Kilp00}. We refer the reader to \cite{Kilp00} for a more thorough treatment of pointed acts and their categorical properties.
\begin{definition}
    A pointed monoid is a $4$-tuple $(S,\ast,1,0)$, where $0,1\in S$ and $\ast: S\times S \to S$ is a map, that satisfies the following
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item $\forall x,y,z\in S: (x\ast y)\ast z = x\ast(y\ast z)$
        \item $\forall x\in S: x\ast 1 = x = 1\ast x$
        \item $\forall x\in S: x\ast 0 = 0 = 0\ast x$
    \end{enumerate}
    we will call $1$ the \textbf{unit} of $(S,\ast,1,0)$ and $0$ the \textbf{zero} of $(S,\ast,1,0)$. We will often identify
    such a $4$-tuple with its underlying set $S$, if the structure is generic or clear from context. Often we will also write
    $xy$ instead of $x\ast y$ and omit unnecessary brackets.
\end{definition}
\begin{example}
    The most natural examples are $(\mathbb{N}_0, \cdot, 1,0)$ and $(\mathbb{N}_0\cup\{\infty\}, +,0,\infty)$. Given any ring $(R,+,-,0,\cdot,1)$ 
    we can also forget some of the structure and get a pointed monoid $(R,\cdot,1,0)$.  
\end{example}
\begin{example}
    In general, given any monoid $(M,\cdot,1)$, we can consider the disjoint union $\{\bullet\}\times\{0\}\cup M\times\{1\}$ with any one element set
    $\{\bullet\}$ and extend the operation $\cdot$ as
    \[
        (m,1)\cdot(n,1) = (m\cdot n,1)
    \]
    \[
        (m,1)\cdot(\bullet, 0) = (\bullet, 0) = (\bullet,0)\cdot(m,1)
    \]
    \[
        (\bullet,0)\cdot(\bullet,0) = (\bullet,0)
    \]
    which gives us a pointed monoid, with the further property that $ab=0 \implies a=0 \lor b=0$. It can be shown that if pointed monoid 
    has this property, then it is isomorphic to this construction.
\end{example}

\begin{definition}
    Let $S$ be a pointed monoid. A (left) pointed $S$-act is a $3$-tuple $(A,\cdot, 0)$, where $0\in A$ and $\cdot: S\times A \to A$ 
    is a map, that satisfies the following
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item $\forall r,s\in S\, \forall x\in A : (r\ast s)\cdot x = r\cdot(s\cdot x)$
        \item $\forall x\in A : 1\cdot x = x$
        \item $\forall x\in A : 0\cdot x = 0$
    \end{enumerate}
    it then follows that $r\cdot 0 = r\cdot (0\cdot 0) = (r\ast 0)\cdot 0 = 0\cdot 0 = 0$ and that 
    such an element $0$ satisfying $3.$ is necessarily unique. We will call the element $0\in A$ the 
    \textbf{sink} of $A$.
\end{definition}
\begin{example}
    Any pointed monoid can be considered as a pointed act over itself, where the action $\cdot$ is just the multiplication in the monoid. 
    Given a module $(M,+,-,0,\cdot)$ over a ring $(R,+,-,0,\cdot,1)$ we can view it as a pointed act $(M,\cdot,0)$ over the pointed monoid $(R,\cdot,1,0)$.
\end{example}
\begin{example}
    We can consider any pointed set $(X,x_0)$ (that is $X$ a set and $x_0\in X$) to be pointed $\mathbb{Z}_2$-act for the pointed monoid $(\mathbb{Z}_2,\cdot,1,0)$,
    by letting $1\cdot x = x$ and $0\cdot x = x_0$.
\end{example}
\begin{definition}
    Let $A$ be a pointed $S$-act. A \textbf{subact} of $A$ is a subset $B\subseteq A$ such that $0\in B$ and $B$ is closed under the action of $S$. 
    A \textbf{homomorphism} of pointed acts $f: A\to B$ is a map, such that $f(0) = 0$ and $f(r\cdot x) = r\cdot f(x)$ for all $r\in S$ and $x\in A$.
    A \textbf{congruence} on a pointed act $A$ is an equivalence relation $\rho$ on $A$ such that 
    \[
        \forall x,y\in A \,\forall r \in S: (x,y)\in\rho \implies (r\cdot x, r\cdot y)\in\rho
    \]
    A \textbf{factor} of a pointed act $A$ by a congruence $\rho$ is the set of equivalence classes $A/\rho$ with the action defined as $r \cdot [a]_\rho = [r \cdot a]_\rho$ and the zero element $[0]_\rho$. 
    This construction yields a pointed act.
\end{definition}
\begin{example}
    The kernel congruence of a homomorphism $f: A\to B$ is a congruence on $A$ defined as $\ker{f} = \{(x,y)\in A\times A \mid f(x) = f(y)\}$.
\end{example}
\begin{remark}
    The category of pointed acts over a pointed monoid $S$, denoted as $\actcat{S}$ consists of pointed acts as objects and their homomorphisms as morphisms.
    The composition of morphisms and the identity morphisms are defined as in the category of sets, clearly a composition of two homomorphisms yields a homomorphism
    and the identity is trivially a homomorphism.
\end{remark}
\begin{definition}
    If $A$ is a pointed act over a pointed monoid $S$ and there is a subset $\{x_1,\dots,x_n\}\subseteq A$ such that 
    for each $x\in A$ there is an $i\in\{1,\dots,n\}$ and $r\in S$ so that $x = r\cdot x_i$, then we say that $A$ is \textbf{finitely generated} 
    and that the set $\{x_1,\dots,x_n\}$ is a \textbf{generating set} of $A$.
\end{definition}
\begin{definition}
    Let $A\in S\mathrm{-Act}_0$ and $B$ a subact of $A$, then we let 
    \[
        \rho_B = \Delta_A \cup B\times B
    \]
    where $\Delta_A= \{(x,x): x\in A \}$ is the diagonal relation on $A$. We call $\rho_B$ a \textbf{Rees congruence on $A$}. 
\end{definition}
\begin{proof}
    We will show, that $\rho_B$ is a congruence. \par 
    Reflexivity and symmetry of the relation is clear from definition. If $(x,y)\in\rho_B$ and $(y,z)\in\rho_B$, we either have 
    $x=y=z \implies (x,z)\in\rho_B$ or at least one of the pairs is in $B\times B$, if both are then again $(x,z)\in\rho_B$. If 
    say, WLOG, that $x=y$ and $y,z\in B$, then also $x\in B$ and therefore again $(x,z)\in\rho_B$, thus the relation is transitive. 
    If $(x,y)\in\rho_B$ and $r\in S$ we have either $x=y\implies rx=ry$ or $x,y\in B \implies rx,ry\in B$, so $\rho_B$ is a congruence on $A$.
\end{proof}
\begin{remark}
    For $B$ a subact of $A$ we will often denote the factor $A/\rho_B$ as $A/B$. 
\end{remark}

\section{Constructions}
    We prove that the category of pointed acts is complete and cocomplete and the monomorphisms/epimorphisms are precisely injective/surjective homomorphisms, a fact, which can be found in \cite{Kilp00}, though the proof there is omitted. Then we look 
    at localisation of pointed acts, a construction, which to our knowledge isn't yet a part of the literature on the topic.
\begin{proposition}
    Let $f,g: A \to B$ be homomorphisms of pointed acts. Let $\{f=g\} = \{x\in A \mid f(x) = g(x)\}$, then $\{f=g\}$ is a subact of $A$ and 
    the canonical inclusion $\iota: \{f=g\} \to A$, $x\mapsto x$ is an equaliser in $\actcat{S}$.
\end{proposition}
\begin{proof}
    We clearly have that $0\in\{f=g\}$ and $x\in\{f=g\}$ implies $f(x)=g(x)$, hence $f(rx)=rf(x)=rg(x)=g(rx) \implies rx\in\{f=g\}$. 
    Suppose $h: X \to A$ is such that $fh=gh$, then we have that $h(x)\in\{f=g\}$, so we simply let $\overline{h} = h: X\to\{f=g\}$, this
    map is unique. Say there were two maps $\iota\overline{h_1}=h=\iota\overline{h_2}$, then because $\iota$ is injective (so a monomorphism, 
    because we are in a concrete category) we have $\overline{h_1}=\overline{h_2}$.
\end{proof}
    We will denote the equalizer $\{f=0\}$ as $\Kernel{f}$. 
\begin{proposition}
    Suppose $f,g: A\to B$ are homomorphisms, let $\sim$ be the smallest congruence on $B$ such that $\forall x\in A: f(x)\sim g(x)$, then 
    $B/\sim$ with the canonical projection $\pi: B\to B/\sim$, $x\mapsto [x]_\sim$ is a coequaliser of $f$ and $g$ in $\actcat{S}$. 
\end{proposition}
\begin{proof}
    Suppose that $h: B\to X$ is such that $hf=hg$, then we have that $\ker{h}$ is a congruence on $B$, satisfying 
    $\forall x\in A: (f(x),g(x))\in\ker{h}$, therefore $\sim\subseteq\ker{h}$. We need a morphism $\overline{h}: B/\sim \to X$, which satisfies 
    $h = \overline{h} \circ\pi$. The uniqueness is clear, if it exists, since then $\overline{h_1}\circ\pi = h = \overline{h_2}\circ\pi$, 
    which implies $\overline{h_1}=\overline{h_2}$, because $\pi$ is epi. We define $\overline{h}([x]_\sim) = h(x)$, this 
    is clearly a homomorphism of acts and it is well-defined because
    \[
        [x]_\sim = [y]_\sim\iff x\sim y \implies (x,y)\in\ker{h} \implies h(x)=h(y)
    \] 
\end{proof}
    In the case of cokernels, the congruence $\sim$ admits a much nicer description. 
\begin{proposition}
    Let $f: A \to B$ be a homomorphism of pointed acts, then the smallest congruence on $B$ such that $\forall x\in A :f(x)\sim 0$ is
    $\im(f)=\rho_{\Image{f}}$, where $\Image{f} = \{f(x) \mid x\in A\}$.
\end{proposition}
\begin{proof}
    We have that $(f(x),0)\in\Image{f}$, because $0\in\Image{f}$. If $\sim$ is any other such congruence, then for any $f(x),g(x)\in\Image{f}$
    it holds that $f(x)\sim 0 \sim g(x) \implies f(x)\sim g(x)$, therefore $\rho_{\Image{f}}=\Image{f}\times\Image{f}\cup\Delta_B$ is contained in $\sim$.
\end{proof}
We will now construct the products and coproducts in $\actcat{S}$. 
\begin{proposition}
    Let $I$ be a nonempty set, $(X_i)_{i\in I}$ a collection of pointed acts over a pointed monoid $S$, then we define 
    \[
        \prod_{i\in I}X_i = \{f: I \to\bigcup_{i\in I } X_i \mid\forall i\in I :  f(i)\in X_i \}
    \]
    then $\prod_{i\in I}X_i$ admits a structure of a pointed act and along with the canonical projections 
    $\pi_i : \prod_{i\in I }X_i$,$f\mapsto f(i)$ it is the product in the category $\actcat{S}$.
\end{proposition}
\begin{proof}
    We define the action of $S$ on the product componentwise as $(r\cdot f)(i) = r\cdot f(i)$. The zero in the product 
    is the map $i\mapsto 0$. It is routine to check that such a structure satisfies the 
    axioms of pointed acts. By definition of the action and zero we see that $\pi_i$ is a homomorphism. Suppose now that 
    object $U$ along with the maps $\mu_i : U \to X_i$ is a cone in $\actcat{S}$. Define a map $f: U \to\prod_{i\in I} X_i$ 
    as $f(u) = g$, where $\forall i\in I : g(i) = \mu_i(u)$. We have that 
    \[
        f(ru)(i) = \mu_i(ru) = r\mu_i(u) = r\cdot f(u)(i) = (r\cdot f(u))(i)
    \]  
    \[
        f(0)(i) = \mu_i(0) = 0 \implies f(0) = 0
    \]
    so it is a homomorphism of pointed acts that satisfies $\mu_i = \pi_i\circ f$. If $f'$ is any other such map we would have that 
    $\forall i\in I : \pi_i\circ f = \pi_i\circ g$, then fixing $u\in U$ and $i\in I$ we get $g(u)(i) = (\pi_i \circ g)(u) = (\pi_i\circ f)(u) = f(u)(i) \implies g(u)=f(u)$ 
    thus $f=g$.
\end{proof}
\begin{proposition}
    Let $I$ be a nonempty set, $(X_i)_{i\in I}$ a collection of pointed acts over a pointed monoid $S$, we define 
    \[
        \coprod_{i\in I } X_i = \{f\in\prod_{i\in I }X_i \mid \exists j\in I\,\forall i\in I : i\neq j \implies f(i) = 0\}
    \]
    then $\coprod_{i\in I} X_i$ is a subact of the product and along with the canonical inclusions $\iota_i : X_i \to \coprod_{i\in I} X_i$, $x\mapsto f$, where 
    $f(i) = x$ and $f(j)=0$ for $j\neq i$
    forms the coproduct in $\actcat{S}$.
\end{proposition}
\begin{proof}
    Clearly $0\in\coprod_{i\in I } X_i$ and given any $r\in S$ and $f\in\coprod_{i\in I } X_i$, where 
    $f(j)=0$ for each $j\neq i$, then $r\cdot f(j)=0$, hence $r\cdot f \in\coprod_{i\in I} X_i$. It follows that 
    $\coprod_{i\in I} X_i$ is a subact of the product.\par 
    Let $U$ be a pointed act and let $\nu_i : X_i \to U$ be a homomorphism for each $i\in I$, then let $h: \coprod_{i\in I} X_i \to U$ be defined as follows - 
    given any $f$ and $i\in I$, such that $f(j)=0$ for all $j\neq i$, define $h(f) = \nu_i(f(i))$ (Note that this is well-defined 
    even in the case of zero, because $\forall i\in I : \nu_i(0) = 0$). By definition we have that $h\circ \iota_i = \nu_i$. It is 
    indeed a homomorphism, since $r\cdot h(f) = r\cdot\nu_i(f(i))=\nu_i((r\cdot f)(i)) = h(r\cdot f)$. Let 
    $\overline{h} : \coprod_{i\in I } X_i \to U$ be any other morphism, such that $\forall i\in I :\overline{h}\circ\iota_i = \nu_i$ we see, given 
    any $f$, letting $x=f(i)$, where $i\in I$ is such that $\forall j\neq i : f(j)=0$, that 
    \[
        h(f) = \nu_i(x) = \overline{h}(\iota_i(x)) = \overline{h}(f) \implies h=\overline{h} 
    \]
\end{proof}
\begin{corollary}
    The category $\actcat{S}$ is complete and cocomplete.
\end{corollary}
    Our category $\actcat{S}$ equipped with the "forgetful" functor $U$, which maps objects to their underlying sets and morphisms 
    to their underlying set maps is a concrete category. Thus it makes sense, to talk about injective and surjective homomorphisms, 
    the following proposition, which we will use time and time again, without any further reference, shows that they coincide with 
    monomorphisms and epimorphisms in $\actcat{S}$.
\begin{proposition}
    The monomorphisms in $\actcat{S}$ are precisely the injective homomorphisms and the epimorphisms in $\actcat{S}$ are precisely
    the surjective homomorphisms.
\end{proposition}
\begin{proof}
    If $f: A \to B$ is injective, and $h_1,h_2:X \to A$ are such that $f\circ h_1=f\circ h_2$ we have for all $x\in X$ that 
    \[
        f(h_1(x))=f(h_2(x)) \implies h_1(x)=h_2(x)
    \] 
    so $h_1=h_2$ and $f$ is a mono.\par
    Suppose that $f: A \to B$ is surjective and $h_1,h_2: B \to Y$ are such that $h_1\circ f = h_2\circ f$, then 
    for each $b\in B$ there is an $a\in A$ so that $f(a)=b$, hence $h_1(b)=h_1(f(a))=h_2(f(a))=h_2(b)$.\par 
    Assume now $f: A \to B$ is a monomorphism and $x,y\in A$ are such that $f(x)=f(y)$. Let $h_1: S \to A$ and $h_2: S \to A$ be defined 
    as $h_1(s) = sx$ and $h_2(s)=sy$, then $h_1$ and $h_2$ are homomorphisms, since $r h_1(s) = r(sx) = (rs)x = h_1(rs)$ and analogously for $h_2$. 
    Notice that $f(x)=f(y)$ implies that $f\circ h_1 = f\circ h_2$, since $f(h_1(s)) = f(sx) = s f(x) = s f(y) = f(sy) = f(h_2(s))$. Since $f$ is a 
    mono we get $h_1=h_2$, so $x=h_1(1)=h_2(1) = y$. \par 
    Finally suppose that $f: A \to B$ is an epimorphism. Then we can consider two homomorphisms $\pi : B \to B/\im{f}$ and $0: B \to B/\im{f}$, where 
    $\pi$ is the canonical projection and $0$ is the zero morphism. We have that $0 f = 0 = \pi f$, hence $\pi=0$, since $f$ is an epimorphism. 
    This means that $\forall b\in B : [b]=[0]$ or that $b\in\Image{f}$, so $f$ is surjective.
\end{proof}
\begin{corollary}
    The category $\actcat{S}$ is balanced.
\end{corollary}
\begin{proof}
    Indeed, if $f: A \to B$ is a homomorphism of pointed acts that is both a monomorphism and epimorphism, then by the above proposition 
    $f$ is bijective, let $f^{-1}: B \to A$ be its inverse in $\mathbf{Set}$, then for and $y\in B$ we find a unique $x\in A$ such that 
    $f(x)=y$ and we then have for any $r\in S$ that 
    \[
        f^{-1}(ry) = f^{-1}(f(rx))= rx = rf^{-1}(y)
    \]
    hence $f^{-1}$ is a homomorphism of acts and $f$ is an isomorphism.
\end{proof}
\begin{proposition}
    Let $(S,\cdot,1,0)$ be a commutative pointed monoid and 
    $K\subseteq S$ a submonoid of $S$ such that $0\not\in K$. 
    We define $K^{-1}S = S\times K/\sim$, where 
    \[
        (s_1,k_1)\sim(s_2,k_2)\iff \exists v\in K : s_1k_2v = s_2k_1v 
    \]
    then $K^{-1}S$ is well-defined and admits the structure of a pointed commutative monoid.
\end{proposition}
\begin{proof}[Proof]
    Relation $\sim$ is reflexive, since $1\in K$. It is clearly symmetric. 
    Let $(s_1,k_1)\sim(s_2,k_2)\sim(s_3,k_3)$, so there are $v,w\in K$ such that 
    $s_1k_2v = s_2k_1v$ and $s_2k_3w = s_3k_2w$, then 
    \[
    (s_1k_3)k_2vw = s_1k_2vk_3w = s_2k_1vk_3w = s_2k_3wk_1v = s_3k_2wk_1v = (s_3k_1)k_2vw
    \]
    therefore $(s_1,k_1)\sim(s_3,k_3)$. We will denote the equivalence classes as
    $\frac{s}{k} = [s,k]_{\sim}$. Define 
    \[
        \frac{s_1}{k_1}\cdot\frac{s_2}{k_2} = \frac{s_1 s_2}{k_1 k_2}
    \]
    to prove well-definedness assume $(s_1,k_1)\sim(d_1,l_1)$ and $(s_2,k_2)\sim(d_2,l_2)$, then 
    we find $u,v\in K$ such that 
    $s_1l_1u=d_1k_1u$ and $s_2l_2v = d_2k_2v$, then 
    \[
    s_1s_2l_1l_2uv = (s_1l_1u)(s_2l_2)v = d_1k_1ud_2k_2v = d_1d_2k_1k_2uv 
    \]
    thus
    \[
        \frac{s_1}{k_1}\cdot\frac{s_2}{k_2} = \frac{s_1s_2}{k_1k_2} = \frac{d_1d_2}{l_1l_2} = \frac{d_1}{l_1}\cdot\frac{d_2}{l_2}
    \]
    We define the unit $1 = \frac{1}{1}$ and $0 = \frac{0}{1}$. The associativity, commutativity and unit axioms are clearly 
    satisfied. We have 
    \[
        0\cdot\frac{s}{k} = \frac{0}{k} = \frac{0}{1} = 0
    \]
    since $(0,k)\sim(0,1)$, because $0\cdot 1 = 0 = 0\cdot k$. 
\end{proof}
\begin{definition}
    If $S$ is a commutative pointed monoid and $K\subseteq S$ a submonoid of $S$, such that $0\not\in K$, then we define the \textbf{localisation map} $\Lambda: S \to K^{-1}S$ by $\Lambda(x) = \frac{x}{1}$. It is a 
    homomorphism of pointed monoids.  
\end{definition}
\begin{proposition}
    Let $K\subseteq S$ be a submonoid of a commutative pointed monoid $S$ such that $0\not\in K$ and $A$ an $S$ act. We define 
    $K^{-1}A = A\times K/\sim$, where 
    \[
        (a_1,k_1)\sim(a_2,k_2) \iff \exists u\in K : uk_1 a_2 = uk_2 a_1
    \]
    then $K^{-1}A$ admits the structure of a pointed $K^{-1} S$ act.
\end{proposition}
\begin{proof}[Proof]
    The relation is clearly reflexive and symmetric. Assume 
    that $(k_1,a_1)\sim(k_2,a_2)\sim(k_3,a_3)$, so 
    $uk_1a_2 = uk_2a_1$ and $vk_2a_3 = vk_3a_2$ for some $u,v\in K$, then 
    \[
        uvk_2(k_1a_3) = uk_1vk_2a_3 = uk_1vk_3a_2 = vk_3uk_1a_2 = vk_3uk_2a_1 = uvk_2(k_3a_1)
    \] 
    thus the relation is an equivalence. Denote the equivalence classes as $\frac{a}{k} = [a,k]_\sim$. 
    Define the action of $K^{-1}S$ on $K^{-1}A$ by 
    \[
        \frac{s_1}{k_1}\cdot\frac{a}{k} = \frac{s_1 a}{k_1 k}
    \]
    to show well-definedness assume $\frac{s_1}{k_1}=\frac{s_2}{k_2}$ and $\frac{a_1}{l_1}=\frac{a_2}{l_2}$, then 
    we find $u,v\in K$ such that $s_1k_2u = s_2k_1u$ and $vl_1a_2 = vl_2a_1$, then we have 
    \[
        uvk_2l_2s_1a_1 = s_1k_2uvl_2a_1 = s_2k_1uvl_1a_2 = uvk_1l_1s_2a_2 \implies \frac{s_1a_1}{k_1l_1} = \frac{s_2a_2}{k_2l_2}
    \]
    so
    \[
        \frac{s_1}{k_1}\cdot\frac{a_1}{l_1} = \frac{s_1a_1}{k_1l_1} = \frac{s_2a_2}{k_2l_2} = \frac{s_2}{k_2}\cdot\frac{a_2}{l_2}
    \]
    which proves that the map is well defined. We have to show that it is an action. 
    The associativity and unit axiom is trivial. Define $0 = \frac{0}{1}$, then 
    \[
        0\cdot\frac{a}{k} = \frac{0}{1}\cdot \frac{a}{k} = \frac{0}{k} = \frac{0}{1} = 0
    \]
    since $k\cdot 0 = 1\cdot 0$. Hence it is really a pointed act over $K^{-1}S$. 
\end{proof}
\begin{proposition}
    Suppose that $S$ is a commutative pointed monoid and $K\subseteq S$ a submonoid of $S$, such that $0\not\in K$ and let $f: A\to B$ be an act homomorphism, then we have an induced 
    map $K^{-1}f : K^{-1}A \to K^{-1}B$ defined as 
    \[
        K^{-1}f\left(\frac{a}{k}\right) = \frac{f(a)}{k}
    \] 
    it is a well-defined homomorphism of acts.
\end{proposition}
\begin{proof}[Proof]
    Assume $\frac{a_1}{k_1}=\frac{a_2}{k_2}$, so we find $u\in K$ such that 
    $uk_2a_1= uk_1a_2$, then 
    \[
        uk_2f(a_1) = f(uk_2a_1) = f(uk_1a_2) = uk_1f(a_2)\] 
        \[ \implies K^{-1}f\left(\frac{a_1}{k_1}\right)=\frac{f(a_1)}{k_1}=\frac{f(a_2)}{k_2} = K^{-1}f\left(\frac{a_2}{k_2}\right)
    \]
    and 
    \[
    \frac{s_1}{k_1}\cdot K^{-1}f\left(\frac{a}{k}\right) = \frac{s_1f(a)}{k_1k} = \frac{f(s_1a)}{k_1k} = 
    K^{-1}f\left(\frac{s_1a}{k_1k}\right) = K^{-1}f\left(\frac{s_1}{k_1}\cdot\frac{a}{k}\right)
    \]
\end{proof}
\begin{proposition}
    We have a localisation functor $K^{-1}:\actcat{S}\to\actcat{K^{-1}S}$.
\end{proposition}
\begin{proof}[Proof]
    Choose $\frac{a}{k}$, then
    \[
    K^{-1}(g\circ f)\left(\frac{a}{k}\right) = \frac{g(f(a))}{k} = K^{-1}g\left(\frac{f(a)}{k}\right) =\] \[=(K^{-1}g\circ K^{-1}f)(\frac{a}{k}) \implies K^{-1}(g\circ f) = K^{-1}g\circ K^{-1}f
    \]
    and 
    \[
        K^{-1}1_A\left(\frac{a}{k}\right) = \frac{a}{k} = 1_{K^{-1}A}(\frac{a}{k}) \implies K^{-1}1_A = 1_{K^{-1}A}
    \]
\end{proof}
\begin{remark}
    The localisation map $\Lambda$ induces a functor (by restriction of scalars) from $\actcat{K^{-1}S}$ to $\actcat{S}$, where given any 
    $A$ a $K^{-1}S$ act we define the action of $S$ on $A$ by $s\cdot a = \Lambda(s)\cdot a$. The functor maps the 
    homomorphisms to themselves. This way we can consider the 
    localisation to be an endofunctor by considering the functor $\Lambda\circ K^{-1}$ instead. 
\end{remark}
\begin{proposition}
    Let $A$ be a pointed act over a commutative pointed monoid $S$ and $K\subseteq S$ a submonoid $S$ such that $0\not\in K$, then 
    if $B\subseteq A$ is a subact of $A$, $K^{-1}B = \{\frac{x}{k}: x \in B\}\subseteq K^{-1}A$ is a subact of $K^{-1}A$ and any subact of $K^{-1}A$ is of the form
    $K^{-1} B$ for some $B$ a subact of $A$. Furthermore this correspondence is one-to-one.
\end{proposition}
\begin{proof}
    First we show, that $K^{-1}B$ is a subact of $K^{-1}A$, we have $0\in K^{-1}B$, since $0\in B$. If $\frac{a}{k}\in K^{-1}B$, 
    then $\frac{r}{s}\cdot \frac{a}{k}\in K^{-1}B$, since $ra\in B$. \par 
    Suppose now that $X\subseteq K^{-1}A$ is a subact of $K^{-1}A$, then let \[B=\{x\in A \mid \exists k \in K : \frac{x}{k}\in X \}\]
    then $B$ is a subact of $A$, indeed $0\in B$ and if $x\in B$ and $r\in S$ we find $k\in K$ such that $\frac{x}{k}\in X$, then 
    $\frac{rx}{k}\in X$, thus $rx\in B$.\par 
    We will now verify that $K^{-1}B = X$. Clearly, if $\frac{a}{k}\in X$, then $a\in B$, so $\frac{a}{k}\in K^{-1}B$. To verify 
    the opposite inclusion, choose $\frac{x}{k}\in K^{-1}B$, then since $x\in B$, we find $l\in K$ such that $\frac{x}{l}\in X$, thus
    $\frac{x}{k} = \frac{l}{k}\frac{x}{l}\in X$, therefore $K^{-1}B = X$. \par 
    To show that this correspondence is one-to-one just note that if $K^{-1}B=K^{-1}C$, then 
    \[
        x\in B \iff \frac{x}{1}\in K^{-1}B \iff \frac{x}{1} \in K^{-1} C \iff x\in C
    \]
\end{proof}
\begin{proposition}
    Let $S$ be a commutative pointed monoid and $K\subseteq S$ is a submonoid of $S$ such that $0\not\in K$.
    If $A$ is a finitely generated pointed act over $S$, then $K^{-1} A$ is.
\end{proposition}
\begin{proof}
    Let $\{x_1,\dots,x_n\}$ be a generating set of $A$. Let $\frac{y}{k}\in K^{-1} A$. We have $y=r\cdot x_i$ for some $i\in\{1,\dots, n\}$,
    then $\frac{y}{k} = \frac{r}{k}\cdot\frac{x_i}{1}$, therefore 
    \[
        \left\{\frac{x_1}{1},\dots,\frac{x_n}{1}\right\}
    \]
    is a generating set of $K^{-1} A$ a finitely generated over $K^{-1}S$.
\end{proof}
\section{Regularity and exactness}
    In this section we define Rees regular morphisms and Rees short exact sequences, these definitions appear in \cite{Flores15} and \cite{Chen02} respectively. 
    A different formulation of proposition \ref{regChar} appears as a remark without proof in \cite{Flores15}. Rest of the section is original work. \par
    For the remaining chapters we fix the following notation, for a homomorphism $f$ by $\im(f)$ we mean the 
    Rees congruence $\rho_{\Image{f}}$. To remind the reader by $\ker{f}$ we mean the kernel congruence $\ker{f} = \{(x,y) \mid f(x)=f(y)\}$
    and $\Kernel{f} = \{x \mid f(x) = 0\}$, $\Image{f} = \{ y \mid \exists x : f(x) =y \}$.
\begin{proposition}
    In the category of pointed acts, every monomorphism is normal (i.e. a kernel of its cokernel). 
\end{proposition}
\begin{proof}[Proof]
    Let $f: K \to A$ be a monomorphism and $\pi : A \to A/\Image{f}$ be the canonical projection. We clearly have that 
    $\pi\circ f = 0$. Let $\hat{f} : S \to A$ be any other homomorphism, such that $\pi\circ\hat{f} = 0$, then 
    given $x\in S$ we have $[\hat{f}(x)]=0$ or equivalently that $\hat{f}(x)\in\Image{f}$, therefore there is a unique 
    $x'\in K$ so that $f(x')=\hat{f}(x)$. Define $\phi(x)=x'$ to be the map from $S$ to $K$. By definition we have 
    $f\circ\phi = \hat{f}$ and this relation defines the map uniquely, because for every element in the image of $\hat{f}$ there 
    is precisely one element in $K$ that can map onto it. It remains to show that $\phi$ is really a homomorphism, fixing the 
    notation as above, let $\phi(rx)=z'$ and $\phi(x)=z_0'$, then we have 
    \[
        f(\phi(rx))=f(z')=\hat{f}(rx)=r\hat{f}(x)=rf(z_0')=f(rz_0')=f(r\phi(x))
    \]
    thus $\phi(rx)=r\phi(x)$, since $f$ is a mono, which concludes the proof.
\end{proof}

\begin{definition}
    Let $A$ and $B$ be pointed acts over a pointed monoid $S$, we say that 
    $f: A\to B$ is \textbf{Rees regular}, if 
    \[
        \rho_{\Kernel{f}} = \ker{f}
    \]
    In diagrams we will denote the fact that $f$ is Rees regular as 
    \[\begin{tikzcd}
	A & B
	\arrow["f", "\circ"{marking}, from=1-1, to=1-2]
\end{tikzcd}\]
\end{definition}
\begin{remark}
    Note that we always have $\rho_{\Kernel{f}}\subseteq\ker{f}$, since $x=y$ or $f(x)=0=f(y)$, which implies $f(x)=f(y)$.
\end{remark}
\begin{proposition}\label{regChar}
    Let $f: A\to B$ be a homomorphism of pointed acts over a pointed monoid $S$, then the following are equivalent
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item $\rho_{A'} = \ker{f}$ for some subact $A'\subseteq A$.
        \item $f$ is Rees regular.
        \item $f: A \to\Image{f}$ is a conormal epimorphism.
    \end{enumerate}
\end{proposition}
\begin{proof}
    $1.\implies 2.$ We will show that $A'=\Kernel{f}$. Let $x\in A'$, then $(x,0)\in\ker{f} \implies f(x)=0 \implies x \in\Kernel{f}$. If $f(x)=0$, then 
    $(x,0)\in\rho_A' \implies x\in A'$. \par
    $2.\implies 3.$ Assume $\rho_{\Kernel{f}} = \ker{f}$ and let $g: A\to X$ be a homomorphism such that $g\circ\iota = 0$, where
    $\iota: \Kernel{f}\to A$ is the canonical inclusion. We need to show that there exists a unique homomorphism $\phi: \Image{f}\to X$ such that
    the following diagram commutes 
    \[\begin{tikzcd}
        && X \\
        {\Kernel{f}} & A && {\Image{f}}
        \arrow["\iota", hook, from=2-1, to=2-2]
        \arrow["g", from=2-2, to=1-3]
        \arrow["f", from=2-2, to=2-4]
        \arrow["{\exists ! \phi}"', dashed, from=2-4, to=1-3]
    \end{tikzcd}\]
    Define $\phi(y) = g(x)$, where $x\in A$ is such that $f(x)=y$. This map is well-defined, because if $f(x)=y=f(x')$, then
    either $x=x'$ or $f(x)=0=f(x') \implies g(x)=0=g(x')$, since $g\circ\iota = 0$. Clearly $\phi\circ f = g$ by definition and $\phi$ 
    is a homomorphism of acts, since $g$ is.
    It remains to verify uniqueness. Suppose that $\phi': \Image{f}\to X$ is another such map, then for any $y\in\Image{f}$ we 
    find a $x\in A$ so that $f(x) = y$, then $\phi'(y) = \phi'(f(x)) = g(x) = \phi(f(x)) = \phi(y)$. \par
    $3. \implies 1.$ Consider the canonical projection $\pi : A \to A/\Kernel{f}$, then $\pi\circ\iota = 0$, therefore 
    there exists a unique map $\phi: \Image{f}\to X$, such that $\phi\circ f = \pi$, then if $f(x)=f(y)$ we have 
    $\phi(f(x))=\phi(f(y)) \implies [x]_{\Kernel{f}}=[y]_{\Kernel{f}}$, hence $x=y$ or $x,y\in\Kernel{f}$, so 
    $\ker{f}=\rho_{\Kernel{f}}$. In particular $1.$ holds.
\end{proof}
\begin{remark}
    Note that $3.$ in the above characterisation is the definition of admissible morphism in $\actcat{S}$, 
    which appears in \cite{Flores15}, though we will continue to refer to them as Rees regular morphism.
\end{remark}
\begin{proposition}\label{regPropChar}
    Assume $f:A \to B$ is Rees regular and $\sim$ a congruence on $A$, the following holds
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item $f$ is a monomorphism, if and only if $\Kernel{f} = \{0\}$.
        \item If $S$ is a commutative pointed monoid, and $K\subseteq S$ its submonoid, such that $0\not\in K$, then $K^{-1}f$ is Rees regular.
        \item If $g: B \to C$ is Rees regular, then $g\circ f$ is.
        \item The canonical projection $\pi : A \to A/\sim$, $x\mapsto [x]$ is Rees regular, if and only if 
        $\sim$ is a Rees congruence.
    \end{enumerate}
\end{proposition}
\begin{proof}[Proof]
    Let $f(x)=f(y)$, then $(x,y)\in\rho_{\Kernel{f}}$, hence $x=y$ or $f(x)=0=f(y)$, implying $x=y$ or $x=0=y$.\par 
    Assume that 
    \[
        K^{-1}f\left(\frac{a}{k_1}\right) = K^{-1}f\left(\frac{b}{k_2}\right)
    \]
    then $f(kk_2a)=kk_2f(a) = kk_1f(b)=f(kk_1b)$ for some $k\in K$, so $(kk_2 a,kk_1b)\in\rho_{\Kernel{f}}$, which implies 
    \[
        \frac{a}{k_1}=\frac{b}{k_2} \lor K^{-1}f\left(\frac{a}{k_1}\right)= \frac{f(a)}{k_1} = 0 = \frac{f(b)}{k_2} = K^{-1}f\left(\frac{b}{k_2}\right) 
    \]
    Assume that $g: B\to C$ is Rees regular and $g(f(x))=g(f(y))$, since $g$ is Rees regular we have 
    \[
        f(x)=f(y) \lor g(f(x))=0=g(f(y)) \implies 
        \]
        \[\implies x=y \lor f(x)=0=f(y) \lor g(f(x))=0=g(f(y)) \implies
    \]
    \[
        \implies x=y \lor g(f(x))=0=g(f(y))
    \]
    hence $\ker{g\circ f} = \rho_{\Kernel{g\circ f}}$.\par
    Suppose the canonical projection is Rees regular, if $x\sim y$, then $[x]=[y]$, hence by regularity 
    $x=y \lor [x]=[0]=[y]$ or equivalently $x=y\lor x,y\in [0]$. Note that $[0]\leq A$, since $x\sim 0 \implies rx\sim r0 = 0$ 
    therefore it is a subact of $A$. If $\sim$ is a Rees congruence we have $[x]=[y] \implies x=y \lor x,y\in A'$ for some $A'\leq A$,
    which means precisely that $x=y$ or $[x]=[0]=[y]$, because $0\in A'$. 
\end{proof}
\begin{definition}
    A \textbf{chain complex} $(A_n,a_{n} : A_n\to A_{n-1})_{n\in\mathbb{Z}}$ is a sequence of acts and act morphisms
    \[\begin{tikzcd}
        \cdots & {A_{n+1}} & {A_n} & {A_{n-1}} & \cdots
        \arrow[from=1-1, to=1-2]
        \arrow["{a_{n+1}}", from=1-2, to=1-3]
        \arrow["{a_n}", from=1-3, to=1-4]
        \arrow[from=1-4, to=1-5]
    \end{tikzcd}\]
    such that for all $n\in\mathbb{Z}$ we have $\im(a_{n+1})\subseteq\ker{a_n}$. Chain complex is \textbf{Rees exact
    at $A_n$}, if $\im(a_{n+1})=\ker{a_n}$. Chain complex is \textbf{Rees exact}, if it is Rees exact at $A_n$ for each $n\in\mathbb{Z}$. 
    We say that a chain complex is \textbf{Rees regular}, if all $a_n$ are Rees regular homomorphisms.
\end{definition}
We will often write $(A,a)$ for short to mean the chain complex $(A_n,a_{n} : A_n\to A_{n-1})_{n\in\mathbb{Z}}$. \par
Given any finite sequence of acts $\begin{tikzcd}
	{A_0} & \cdots & {A_n}
	\arrow["{f_0}", from=1-1, to=1-2]
	\arrow["{f_{n-1}}", from=1-2, to=1-3]
\end{tikzcd}$ we say that the sequence is Rees exact, if $\forall n\in\{1,\dots,n-1\} : \ker{d_n} = \im(d_{n-1})$.
\begin{lemma} 
    A sequence $(A_n,a_{n} : A_n\to A_{n-1})_{n\in\mathbb{Z}}$ of pointed acts and their morphisms is a chain complex, if and only if $a_{n+1}\circ a_n = 0$. If $(A,a)$ is a chain complex 
    we always have that $\Image{a_{n+1}}\subseteq\Kernel{a_n} \forall n\in\mathbb{Z}$.
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}[Proof]
    Choose $n\in\mathbb{Z}$. 
    If $\im(a_{n+1})\subseteq\ker{a_n}$ we have for $x\in A_{n+1}$ that
    $(a_{n+1}(x),0)\in\im(a_{n+1})\subseteq\ker{a_n}$, so $(a_n\circ a_{n+1})(x) = 0$. Now assume that $a_{n+1}\circ a_n = 0$, then 
    if $(x,y)\in\im(a_{n+1})$ we either have $x=y$, which trivially implies that $a_n(x)=a_n(y)$ or 
    $\exists x_0,y_0\in A_{n+1}$ such that $a_{n+1}(x_0)=x\land a_{n+1}(y_0)=y$, which implies 
    \[
        a_n(x) = a_n(a_{n+1}(x_0)) = 0 = a_n(a_{n+1}(y_0)) = a_n(y)
    \]
    so $(x,y)\in\ker{a_n}$.\par
    If $y\in A_n$ is such that $a_{n+1}(y_0)=y$ for some $y_0\in A_{n+1}$ we 
    have $a_n(y) = a_n(a_{n+1}(y_0)) = 0 \implies y\in\Kernel{a_n}$.
\end{proof}
\begin{definition}
    Let $(A,a)$ be a chain complex and $n\in\mathbb{Z}$ we define the $n$-th homology act $H_n(A)$ as 
    \[
        H_n(A) = \Kernel{a_n}/\im(a_{n+1})
    \]
\end{definition}
\begin{proposition}\label{regularityProp}
    Given a sequence of pointed acts 
    \[\begin{tikzcd}
        \cdots & {A_{n+1}} & {A_n} & {A_{n-1}} & \cdots
        \arrow[from=1-1, to=1-2]
        \arrow["{a_{n+1}}", from=1-2, to=1-3]
        \arrow["{a_n}", from=1-3, to=1-4]
        \arrow[from=1-4, to=1-5]
    \end{tikzcd}\]
    the following are equivalent for each $n\in\mathbb{Z}$
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item $\im(a_{n+1})=\ker{a_n}$
        \item $\Image{a_{n+1}}=\Kernel{a_n}$ and $a_n$ is Rees regular.
    \end{enumerate}
\end{proposition}
\begin{proof}[Proof]
    Assume exactness at $A_n$ and let $a_n(x)=0$, then $(x,0)\in\im(a_{n+1})$, if 
    $x=0$, then trivially $a_{n+1}(0)=x$, else we find $x_0\in A_{n+1},x_0\neq 0$ such that $a_{n+1}(x_0)=x$, thus
    $\Kernel{a_n}=\Image{a_{n+1}}$ by the previous remark. Let $a_n(x)=a_n(y)$,$x\neq y$, then $(x,y)\in\ker{a_n}=\im(a_{n+1})$, 
    so $a_{n+1}(x_0)=x$ and $a_{n+1}(y_0)=y$ for some $x_0,y_0\in A_{n+1}$, therefore 
    \[
        a_n(x)= a_n(a_{n+1}(x_0)) = 0 = a_n(a_{n+1}(y_0)) = a_n(y) \implies (x,y)\in\rho_\Kernel{a_n}
    \]
    Assume that the second condition holds. We have $\ker{a_n} = \rho_{\Kernel{a_n}} = \rho_{\Image{a_{n+1}}} = \im(a_{n+1})$, 
    which concludes the proof.
\end{proof}
\begin{remark}
    For a Rees regular chain complex $(A,a)$ we have that $(A,a)$ is Rees exact at $A_n$, if and only if $H_n(A)=0$.
\end{remark}
\begin{definition}
    Let $(A,a)$ and $(B,b)$ be two chain complexes. A \textbf{chain map} $f:(A,a)\to(B,b)$ is a sequence of act morphisms $(f_n: A_n\to B_n)$ 
    such that $\forall n\in\mathbb{Z}$ the following square diagram commutes
    \[\begin{tikzcd}
        {A_n} && {B_n} \\
        \\

    \end{tikzcd}\]
\end{definition}
\begin{proposition}
    Chain complexes of acts along with chain maps form a category $\mathrm{Ch}(\actcat{S})$.
\end{proposition}
\begin{proof}
    Indeed, for $f:(A,a)\to (B,b)$ and $g:(B,b)\to (C,c)$ define $g\circ f$ componentwise as 
    $(g\circ f)_n = g_n \circ f_n$. For a chain complex $(A,a)$ we let the identity $1_{(A,a)}$ 
    be defined as $(1_{(A,a)})_n = 1_{A_n}$. The composition is associative, because it is associative 
    componentwise and the identity acts as the identity on components.
\end{proof}
\begin{proposition}
    Let $f: (A,a) \to (B,b)$ be a chain map and $n\in\mathbb{Z}$, then we have an induced map $H_n(f) : H_n(A) \to H_n(B)$
    defined as $H_n(f)([x]) = [f_n(x)]$. This makes $H_n(\bullet)$ into a functor from $\mathrm{Ch}(\actcat{S})$ to $\actcat{S}$.
\end{proposition}
\begin{proof}[Proof]
    We need to show well-definedness. Assume that $[x]=[y]$, if $x=y$ we are done, otherwise $x,y\in\Image{a_{n+1}}$ so we 
    find $x_0,y_0\in A_{n+1}$ such that $a_{n+1}(x_0) = x$,$a_{n+1}(y_0)=y$. By commutativity $f_n(x)=f_n(a_{n+1}(x_0))=b_{n+1}(f_{n+1}(x_0))$
    and $f_n(y) = f_n(a_{n+1}(y_0))=b_{n+1}(f_{n+1}(y_0))$, thus $[f_n(x)]=[0]=[f_n(y)]$. The fact that $H_n(f)$ is a homomorphism 
    is clear from the definition.\par 
    Next we compute
    \[
        H_n(1_{(A,a)})([x]) = [1_{A_n}(x)] = [x] \implies H_n(1_{(A,a)}) = 1_{H_n(A)}
    \]
    \[
        H_n(g\circ f)([x]) = [g_n(f_n(x))] = H_n(g)([f_n(x)]) =
    \]
    \[
         =(H_n(g)\circ H_n(f))([x]) \implies H_n(g\circ f) = H_n(g)\circ H_n(f)
    \]
\end{proof}
\begin{lemma}
    If $f: (A,a)\to (B,b)$ is a chain map and $f_n$ is Rees regular, then $H_n(f)$ is Rees regular.
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}[Proof]
    Assume $[f_n(x)]=H_n(f)([x])=H_n(f)([y])=[f_n(y)]$, then $f_n(x)=f_n(y) \implies x=y$ or $f_n(x)=0=f_n(y)$ or 
    $f_n(x),f_n(y)\in\Image{b_{n+1}}$. In either case we have $[x]=[y]$ or $H_n(f)([x])=[f_n(x)]=0=[f_n(y)]=H_n(f)([y])$.
\end{proof}
\begin{definition}
    We say that a chain complex $(A,a)$ of pointed acts is \textbf{bounded above}, if there is some $n\in\mathbb{Z}$ such that 
    $A_m=0$ for all $m\geq n$. Similarly we say that $(A,a)$ is \textbf{bounded below}, if there exists $n\in\mathbb{Z}$ such that 
    $A_m=0$ for all $m\leq n$. Chain complex $(A,a)$ is \textbf{bounded}, if it is bounded above and below.
\end{definition}
\begin{definition}
    A \textbf{Rees short exact sequence} is a bounded Rees exact chain complex of the form
    \[\begin{tikzcd}
        0 & A & B & C & 0
        \arrow[from=1-1, to=1-2]
        \arrow["f", from=1-2, to=1-3]
        \arrow["g", from=1-3, to=1-4]
        \arrow[from=1-4, to=1-5]
    \end{tikzcd}\]
\end{definition}
\begin{remark}
    By the definition of exactness it follows that $\ker{f} = \{(0,0)\}\cup\Delta_A \land \im(g)= C\times C$, therefore 
    $f$ is injective and $g$ is surjective. Similarly injectivity of $f$ and surjecivity of $g$ imply exactness at $A$ 
    and $C$ respectively.
\end{remark}
\begin{example}
    Let $A$ and $B$ be acts, then we have the following Rees short exact sequence
    \[\begin{tikzcd}
        0 & A & {A\coprod B} & B & 0
        \arrow[from=1-1, to=1-2]
        \arrow["\iota", from=1-2, to=1-3]
        \arrow["\lambda", from=1-3, to=1-4]
        \arrow[from=1-4, to=1-5]
    \end{tikzcd}\]
    where $\iota: x \mapsto (x,0)$ and $\lambda(x,y) = y$.
    the exactness at $A$ and $B$ is easily seen. We will show exactness 
    at $A\coprod B$.\par
    Choose $((x_1,y_1),(x_2,y_2))\in\im(\iota)$, if $x_1=x_2$ and $y_1=y_2$ we are done, 
    otherwise we have $y_1=0=y_2$, therefore 
    \[
        \lambda(x_1,y_1)=0=\lambda(x_2,y_2)
    \]
    which implies $\im(\iota)\subseteq\ker{\lambda}$.
    Let $((x_1,y_1),(x_2,y_2))\in\ker{\lambda}$, if $x_1=x_2$ and $y_1=y_2$
    we are done, therefore assume that $x_1\neq x_2$ or $y_1\neq y_2$.\par
    Suppose $x_1=0$, then $x_2\neq 0$ (else $y_1=y_2$), this implies
    that $y_2=0$ and $y_1=\lambda(x_1,y_1)=\lambda(x_2,y_2)=0$
    so $(x_1,y_1)=(0,0)$ and $y_2=0$, then 
    $\iota(x_2)=(x_2,y_2)$ and $\iota(0)=(x_1,y_1)$.\par
    Suppose now that $x_1\neq 0$, then $y_1=0$ and 
    $\lambda(x_2,y_2)=\lambda(x_1,y_1)=0$, which means either 
    $(x_2,y_2)=(0,0)$ or that $x_2\neq 0$, in either case $y_2=0$,
    hence $\iota(x_1)=(x_1,y_1)$ and $\iota(x_2)=(x_2,y_2)$.
    In conclusion $\ker{\lambda}=\im(\iota)$ as required.
\end{example}
\begin{example}
    If $B$ is a subact of $A$, then the following sequence is Rees short exact 
    \[\begin{tikzcd}
        0 & B & A & {A/B} & 0
        \arrow[from=1-1, to=1-2]
        \arrow["\iota", from=1-2, to=1-3]
        \arrow["\pi", from=1-3, to=1-4]
        \arrow[from=1-4, to=1-5]
    \end{tikzcd}\]
    where $\iota$ is the set inclusion map and $\pi$ is the canonical projection. 
    The exactness at $A$ and $A/B$ is trivial. Choose $x\in B$, then we have 
    $\pi(\iota(x)) = \pi(x) = [x] = [0] \implies \im(\iota)\subseteq\ker{\pi}$. Choose 
    $(x,y)\in\ker{\pi}$, so $[x]=[y]$, if $x=y$, then it is trivially in $\im(\iota)$, else 
    we necessarily have $[x]=[0]=[y]$, so $x,y\in B$ as required.
\end{example}
In contrast with the category of modules, the 
internal hom functor isn't left exact. We give a counterexample, a different 
counterexample already appears in \cite{Chen02}.
\begin{example}
    Recall that we can consider pointed sets to be $\mathbb{Z}_2$ acts. Consider a 
    short exact sequence of pointed sets (where we consider $0$ to be the base point of our pointed sets and by $\mathbb{Z}_n$ we mean the set $\{0,\dots,n-1\})$
    \[\begin{tikzcd}
        0 & {\mathbb{Z}_2} & {\mathbb{Z}_3} & {\mathbb{Z}_3/\mathbb{Z}_2} & 0
        \arrow[from=1-1, to=1-2]
        \arrow["\iota", hook, from=1-2, to=1-3]
        \arrow["\pi", two heads, from=1-3, to=1-4]
        \arrow[from=1-4, to=1-5]
    \end{tikzcd}\]
    where $\iota$ is the inclusion map and $\pi$ is the canonical projection.
    We will show that the following sequence isn't exact at $\text{Hom}(\mathbb{Z}_3,\mathbb{Z}_3)$
    \[\begin{tikzcd}
        0 & {\text{Hom}(\mathbb{Z}_3,\mathbb{Z}_2)} & {\text{Hom}(\mathbb{Z}_3,\mathbb{Z}_3)} & {\text{Hom}(\mathbb{Z}_3,\mathbb{Z}_3/\mathbb{Z}_2)}
        \arrow[from=1-1, to=1-2]
        \arrow["{\iota_*}", from=1-2, to=1-3]
        \arrow["{\pi_*}", from=1-3, to=1-4]
    \end{tikzcd}\]
    Note that $\left|\text{Hom}(\mathbb{Z}_3,\mathbb{Z}_2)\right| = 2^{3-1}$, since $0\mapsto 0$, similarly we have 
    $\left|\text{Hom}(\mathbb{Z}_3,\mathbb{Z}_3) \right| =9$ and $\left|\text{Hom}(\mathbb{Z}_3,\mathbb{Z}_3/\mathbb{Z}_2)\right| = 4$.
    Clearly we then have $\left|\Image{\iota_*}\right|\leq 4$. If $\pi_*$ were to be Rees regular, then necessarily 
    $\left|\Kernel{\pi_*}\right| \geq 6$, so we cannot have that $\Image{\iota_*}=\Kernel{\pi_*}$.
\end{example}
\begin{proposition}
    Consider the following Rees short exact sequence
    \[\begin{tikzcd}
        0 & A & B & C & 0
        \arrow[from=1-1, to=1-2]
        \arrow[from=1-2, to=1-3]
        \arrow[from=1-3, to=1-4]
        \arrow[from=1-4, to=1-5]
    \end{tikzcd}\]
    then if $A$ and $C$ are finitely generated, then so is $B$, and if $B$ is finitely generated, then so is $C$.
\end{proposition}
\begin{proof}
    Assume that $\{x_1,\dots,x_n\}$ generates $A$ and $\{z_1,\dots,z_m\}$ generated $C$. By surjectivity of $g$ we find 
    for each $i\in\{1,\dots,m\}$ an element $y_i\in B$ such that $g(y_i)=z_i$. We will show that the set 
    \[
        \{f(x_1),\dots,f(x_n),y_1,\dots,y_m\}
    \]
    generates $B$. Choose any $y\in B$, then if $y\in\Kernel{g}$ we find $x\in A$ such that $f(x)=y$, but then 
    $x=r\cdot x_i$ for some $r\in S$ and $i\in\{1,\dots,n\}$, which implies that $y=r\cdot f(x_i)$. Assume now that $y\not\in\Kernel{g}$,
    then $f(y) = r\cdot z_i = r\cdot f(y_i) = f(r\cdot y_i)$ for some $i\in\{1,\dots,m\}$, hence $y=r\cdot y_i$, since $g$ is Rees regular, therefore 
    injective up to Kernel. This proves that the set $\{f(x_1),\dots,f(x_n),y_1,\dots,y_m\}$ generates B. \par 
    Suppose that $\{y_1,\dots,y_n\}$ generates $B$. Choose $z\in C$, then we find some $y\in B$ such that $g(y)=z$, then 
    $y=r\cdot y_i$ for some $i\in\{1,\dots,n\}$, which implies $z=r\cdot g(y_i)$, therefore $\{g(y_1),\dots,g(y_m)\}$ generates $C$.
\end{proof}
\begin{proposition}
    Assume that $S$ is a commutative, pointed monoid and $K\subseteq S$ is a submonoid of $S$ such that $0\not\in K$, then
    given a Rees short exact sequence 
    \[\begin{tikzcd}
        0 & A & B & C & 0
        \arrow[from=1-1, to=1-2]
        \arrow[from=1-2, to=1-3]
        \arrow[from=1-3, to=1-4]
        \arrow[from=1-4, to=1-5]
    \end{tikzcd}\]
    the following sequence is Rees short exact
    \[\begin{tikzcd}
        0 & {K^{-1}A} & {K^{-1}B} & {K^{-1}C} & 0
        \arrow[from=1-1, to=1-2]
        \arrow[from=1-2, to=1-3]
        \arrow[from=1-3, to=1-4]
        \arrow[from=1-4, to=1-5]
    \end{tikzcd}\]
\end{proposition}
\begin{proof}[Proof]
    Let $\frac{a}{k}\in K^{-1}A$, then 
    \[
    (K^{-1}g\circ K^{-1}f)\left(\frac{a}{k}\right) = \frac{g(f(a))}{k} = \frac{0}{k} =\frac{0}{1}=0 \implies \im(K^{-1}f)\subseteq\ker{K^{-1}g}
    \]
    Assume that $\frac{g(b_1)}{k_1}=\frac{g(b_2)}{k_2}$, so we find $u\in K$ such that 
    $g(uk_1b_2)=uk_1g(b_2)=uk_2g(b_1)=g(uk_2b_1)$, therefore 
    $(uk_1b_2,uk_2b_1)\in\im(f)$. If $uk_1b_2=uk_2b_1$ we are done, otherwise 
    we find $z_1,z_2\in A$ such that $f(z_1) = uk_1b_2$ and $f(z_2)=uk_2b_1$.
    then 
    \[
        K^{-1}f\left(\frac{z_1}{uk_1k_2}\right) = \frac{uk_1b_2}{uk_1k_2} = \frac{b_2}{k_2}
    \] 
    \[
        K^{-1}f\left(\frac{z_2}{uk_2k_1}\right) = \frac{uk_2b_1}{uk_2k_1} = \frac{b_1}{k_1}
    \]
    which proves exactness at $K^{-1}B$, we have to show that $K^{-1}$ preserves injections and surjections.
    Suppose $\frac{f(a_1)}{k_1}=\frac{f(a_2)}{k_2}$, then find $u\in K^{-1}$ such that 
    \[
        uk_1f(a_2) = uk_2f(a_1)\implies f(uk_1a_2)=f(uk_2a_1) \implies
    \] 
    \[
        \implies uk_1a_2=uk_2a_1 \implies\frac{a_1}{k_1}=\frac{a_2}{k_2}
    \]
    To prove surjectivity choose $\frac{z}{k}\in K^{-1}C$, we find $y\in B$ such that $g(y)=z$, then 
    \[
        K^{-1}g\left(\frac{y}{k}\right) = \frac{g(y)}{k} = \frac{z}{k}
    \]
    which completes the proof.
\end{proof}
\begin{corollary}
    Let $B$ be a subact of $A$, then $K^{-1}B$ is a subact of $K^{-1}A$ and  
    \[
        K^{-1}\left(\frac{A}{B}\right) \simeq \frac{K^{-1}A}{K^{-1}B}
    \]
\end{corollary}
\begin{proof}[Proof]
    Consider the Rees short exact sequence 
    \[\begin{tikzcd}
        0 & {K^{-1}B} & {K^{-1}A} & {K^{-1}(A/B)} & 0
        \arrow[from=1-1, to=1-2]
        \arrow["{K^{-1}\iota}", from=1-2, to=1-3]
        \arrow["{K^{-1}\pi}", from=1-3, to=1-4]
        \arrow[from=1-4, to=1-5]
    \end{tikzcd}\]
    $K^{-1}B$ is clearly a subset of $K^{-1}A$, it contains zero, since $B$ contains zero and 
    it is closed under the monoidal action, because $B$ is.
    First we need to show that $\im K^{-1}\iota = \rho_{K^{-1}B}$, we have 
    \[
    \left(\frac{b_1}{k_1},\frac{b_2}{k_2}\right)\in\im(S^{-1}\iota) \iff \frac{b_1}{k_1}=\frac{b_2}{k_2}\lor\exists\,\frac{a_1}{l_1},\frac{a_2}{l_1}\in K^{-1}B :
    \frac{a_1}{l_1}=\frac{b_1}{k_1}\land\frac{a_2}{l_2}=\frac{b_2}{k_2}
    \]
    \[
        \iff \frac{b_1}{k_1}=\frac{b_2}{k_2}\lor \frac{b_1}{k_1},\frac{b_2}{k_2}\in K^{-1}B \iff \left(\frac{a_1}{k_1},\frac{a_2}{k_2}\right)\in\rho_{K^{-1}B}
    \]
    then by the first isomorphism theorem for acts/universal algebras \cite[Theorem~4.21]{Kilp00} we have 
    \[
    K^{-1}(A/B)\simeq K^{-1}(A)/\ker{K^{-1}\pi} = K^{-1}(A)/\im(K^{-1}\iota) = K^{-1}A/K^{-1}B
    \]
\end{proof}
\section{Rees simple acts}
    In this section we define and prove some properties of a class of pointed acts, which we will call Rees simple acts. Motivation for this 
    definition are Dedekind groups, i.e. groups whose every subgroup is normal. It can be shown, that Dedekind groups are precisely objects of $\mathbf{Grp}$
    such that every monomorphism into them is normal. As we will see the property of being Rees simple, is dual. It is precisely those pointed acts, such that 
    every epimorphism from them is conormal.
\begin{definition}
    Let $S$ be a pointed monoid and $A$ be a pointed act over $S$, then we call $A$
    \textbf{Rees simple}, if every congruence in $A$ is Rees (i.e. of the form $\rho_B$ for some $B\subseteq A$ a subact of $A$).
\end{definition}
\begin{example}
    Let $(\mathbb{N}_0, +, 0, \infty)$ be a pointed monoid. We can consider it as an act over itself. For $n\in\mathbb{N}_0$ let 
    $n_> = \{x\in\mathbb{N}_0 \mid x > n\}$, then $n_>$ is a subact of $\mathbb{N}_0$, indeed $\infty\in n_>$ and if $a > n$, then 
    surely $r+a > n$ for any $r \geq 0$, then $\mathbb{N}_0/n_>$ is a pointed act over $\mathbb{N}_0$. Let $\sim$ be a congruence on 
    $\mathbb{N}_0/n_>$, suppose it isn't the diagonal congruence, which is trivially Rees, then there is $m\in\mathbb{N}_0$ and $k>0$ such that 
    $m\sim k+m$, but then, since $\sim$ is a congruence we have that $m\sim k+m\sim 2k+m \sim\dots \sim lk+m \sim \infty$, where $l$
    is large enough, such that $lk+m > n$, hence $x\sim y \iff x=y$ or $x,y > n$. It follows that any congruence is Rees. 
\end{example}
\begin{proposition}
    Let $A$ be a pointed act over a pointed monoid $S$, then TFAE
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item Every morphism $f: A \to X$ for all $X\in\actcat{S}$ is Rees regular (a conormal epimorphism onto its image).
        \item $A$ is Rees simple.
    \end{enumerate}
\end{proposition}
\begin{proof}[Proof]
    $1. \implies 2.$\par 
    Let $\kappa$ be a congruence in $A$, then $\kappa=\ker{\pi}$, where $\pi: A \to A/\kappa$ is the canonical projection, by 
    assumption $\pi$ si Rees regular, it follows that $\kappa$ is a Rees congruence by proposition \ref{regPropChar}. \par 
    $2. \implies 1.$\par 
    Let $f: A\to X$ be a homomorphism, then $\ker{f}$ is a Rees congruence, since $A$ is Rees simple, hence by proposition \ref{regChar} 
    we have that $f$ is Rees regular.
\end{proof}
\begin{proposition}
    Consider a Rees short exact sequence 
    \[
        \begin{tikzcd}
            0 & A & B & C & 0
            \arrow[from=1-1, to=1-2]
            \arrow["f", from=1-2, to=1-3]
            \arrow["g", from=1-3, to=1-4]
            \arrow[from=1-4, to=1-5]
        \end{tikzcd}
    \]
    if $B$ is Rees simple, then so are $A$ and $C$.
\end{proposition}
\begin{proof}
    Let $\kappa$ be a congruence on $A$, then we define a congruence $\rho$ on $B$ as $(x,y)\in\rho \iff x=y \lor (x=f(x_0), y=f(y_0) \land (x_0,y_0)\in\kappa)$. 
    It is easy to see, that it is indeed a congruence relation, hence there is some $B'\subseteq B$ such that $\rho = \rho_{B'}$, then 
    $f^{-1}(B')$ is a subact of $A$, since $f(0)=0\in B'$ and if $f(x)\in B'$, then $rf(x)=f(rx)\in B'$. We want to show that 
    $\kappa = \rho_{f^{-1}(B')}$. If $(x,y)\in\kappa$ and $x\neq y$, then $f(x)\neq f(y)$ by injectivity of $f$, hence 
    $(f(x),f(y))\in\rho$, which implies that $x,y\in f^{-1}(B')$. Suppose otherwise, that $f(x),f(y)\in B'$, then $(f(x),f(y))\in\rho$, 
    which either implies $f(x)=f(y) \implies x=y$ or that $(x,y)\in\kappa$, which concludes the proof.\par
    Let $\kappa$ be a congruence on $C$, then $g^{-1}(\kappa) := \{(x,y) : (g(x),g(y))\in\kappa\}$ is clearly a congruence on 
    $B$, so we find $B'\subseteq B$ such that $g^{-1}(\kappa)=\rho_{B'}$. We will show that $\kappa=\rho_{g(B')}$. Let $(x,y)\in\kappa$ be such that $x\neq y$, then we find $x_0,y_0\in B$, where 
    $g(x_0)=x$ and $g(y_0)=y$, then $x_0\neq y_0$ and $(x_0,y_0)\in g^{-1}(\kappa)=\rho_{B'}$, therefore $x_0,y_0\in B' \implies x,y\in g(B')$. Let $(x,y)\in\rho_g(B')$ and $x\neq y$,
    we find $x_0,y_0\in B'$ so that $g(x_0)=x$ and $g(y_0)=y$. We now have have that $(x_0,y_0)\in g^{-1}(\kappa)$, hence $(x,y)\in\kappa$.
\end{proof}
