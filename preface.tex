To study monoids and their structure an important idea is to consider the categories of monoidal actions -- acts -- of a given monoid. 
We want to make use of our intuition we have for modules over rings. The category of acts fails in many ways to
which are kernel pairs and cokernel pairs. In some ways, this is nice. 
Many important tools from homological algebra can then be formulated for acts.\par 
In chapter $1$ we recall some basic definitions and results from category theory, in the second 
chapter we
