    In the thesis, we have constructed localisation of pointed acts and shown that the localisation functor preserves Rees short exact sequences. We 
have defined Rees simple acts and proved some of their basic properties. In the central part of the thesis, we have defined chain complexes of pointed acts and 
proved that an analogue of the zigzag lemma holds for their homology acts. We gave proof of the snake lemma and the nine lemma for acts, using proposition \ref{regularityProp}, we have 
also given a novel proofs for the four and the five lemmata using the same proposition. \par 
    Possible ways the work can be extended would be to look at injective resolutions of acts, since they always yield Rees exact complexes, and see, if there is some notion, in which 
different resolutions are similar, i.e. if there is a suitable notion of chain homotopy, or if there is a more fruitful definition for chain complexes of pointed acts altogether. We are also of the 
opinion that the category $(\actcat{S})^{\mathrm{op}}$ might be homological, or exact, which would imply some of the results in Chapter 3. Further work can also be done to give a structural characterisation 
of Rees simple acts, which we have failed to find.
